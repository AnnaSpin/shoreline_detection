# (i) Required Python packages

(a) numpy

(b) scipy

(c) cv2

(d) gdal

(e) matplotlib

# (ii) Input files

The code accepts tiff files. To visualize tiff files please consider the software qGIS, a free and open source geographic information system (https://www.qgis.org/en/site/). In case of large files, please also consider to clip the raster with vector boundaries of the area of interest.

# (iii) How to run shoreline_detection.py

* python3 run_shoreline_detection.py

Inputs in the configs/sample_config.json:

(a) path_to_data: path to the dataset

(b) output_directory: name of the output directory to be created

(c) output_name_tif: name of the tif output file

(d) k: number of the neighborhors defining the size of the kernel implemented to reduce the speckling effect due to the constructive/destructive interferences of backscattered electromagnetic waves, and appearing as a saltâ€“pepper noise in the image. The default size is 5.

# (iv) Outputs

Outputs are saved in a "outputs" folder. The folder "outputs" will contain a tiff file. The folder "outputs" will contain 2 subfolders:

(a) image

Here you will find

* shoreline.png

the resulting image.

(b) image geolocalized

Here you will find

* output_name_tif.tif

containing the geolocalized shoreline. Coordinates are taken from the input image.

Note: as the files.tif are > 25MB, we couldn't upload them in this github repository.
